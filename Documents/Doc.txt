1. Identify the most common types of incidents attended by LFB and their frequency in each year. 
   This analysis could help LFB to identify the areas where they need to focus more resources to reduce the frequency of these types of incidents. 
   Perform clustering analysis to identify the most common types of incidents attended by LFB and their frequency in each year. 
   This could help LFB to identify the areas where they need to focus more resources to reduce the frequency of these types of incidents.
Variables: Incident type, year, frequency of incidents
Analysis: Cluster analysis to group similar incidents based on their frequency and years and identify the most common types of incidents attended by LFB.
        	
2. Analyze the response times of LFB and identify the factors that contribute to the delay in response. 
   This analysis could help LFB to optimize their resources and reduce the response time, which could save lives and minimize damage to properties. 
   Perform regression analysis to identify the factors that contribute to the delay in response of LFB. 
   This could help LFB to optimize their resources and reduce the response time, which could save lives and minimize damage to properties.
Variables: Response time, location, incident type, weather condition, time of day, number of firefighters deployed
Analysis: Regression analysis to identify the factors that contribute to the delay in response of LFB
        
3. Identify the locations with the highest frequency of incidents and analyze the reasons for this trend. 
   This analysis could help LFB to take proactive measures to prevent such incidents in the future, for example, by increasing fire safety awareness or conducting safety inspections in 
   these areas. 
   Perform association rule mining to identify the locations with the highest frequency of incidents and analyze the reasons for this trend. 
   This could help LFB to take proactive measures to prevent such incidents in the future, for example, by increasing fire safety awareness or conducting safety inspections in these areas
Variables: Incident location, incident type, weather condition, time of day, season
Analysis: Association rule mining to identify the patterns and relationships between the variables and the frequency of incidents in different locations
