Encoding categorial columns into numerical




Predictive modeling algorithms:

* Random Forest: This is a popular algorithm for classification and regression tasks. It creates multiple decision trees and combines them to make more accurate predictions. You could use this algorithm to predict the number of pumps needed to attend an incident or the cost of an incident based on the variables in your dataset.

* Linear Regression: This algorithm is useful for predicting numerical outcomes. You could use this algorithm to predict the time taken for the first pump to arrive on the scene based on variables such as the time of call or the type of property involved in the incident.

Descriptive modeling algorithms:

* K-Means Clustering: This algorithm is useful for grouping similar data points together based on their characteristics. You could use this algorithm to cluster incidents based on the property type or the incident category, and identify any patterns or trends that emerge.

* Decision Tree: This algorithm is useful for visualizing the relationships between different variables in your dataset. You could use this algorithm to create a decision tree that shows the most important factors that contribute to the time taken for the first pump to arrive on the scene or the number of pumps needed to attend an incident.





To identify the locations with the highest frequency of incidents, we could use the following columns:

    Postcode_district: This column contains the district of the postcode of the incident. We can group the incidents by postcode district to identify the areas with the highest frequency of incidents.

    IncGeo_WardCode: This column contains the ward code of the incident. We can group the incidents by ward code to identify the wards with the highest frequency of incidents.

To analyze the reasons for this trend, we could use the following columns:

    IncidentGroup: This column contains the group of the incident. We can use this column to identify the types of incidents that are more frequent in the areas with the highest frequency of incidents.

    PropertyCategory and PropertyType: These columns contain information about the property involved in the incident. We can use these columns to identify if there is a higher frequency of incidents in specific types of properties.

    StopCodeDescription: This column contains the stop code description of the incident. We can use this column to identify the reasons for the incidents and if there are any specific patterns in the areas with the highest frequency of incidents.
